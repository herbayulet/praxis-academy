Github has become the corner stone for all things open source software. Developers love it, collaborate on it and are constantly building awesome projects through it. Apart from hosting our code, GitHub's main attraction is using it as a collaborative tool. In this tutorial, let's explore some of the most useful GitHub features, especially for working in teams, making it all the more efficient, productive and, most importantly, fun!

Github and Software Collaboration

    One thing that I find very useful is integrating the Github Wiki into the main source code project.

This tutorial assumes that you are already familiar with Git, the open source distributed version control system, created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. If you need a revision or a lookup on Git, do visit our previous screencast course or even some posts. Also, you should already have a Github account and did some basic functions such as creating a repository and pushing changes to Github. If not, head over to more past tutorials on that.

In the world of software projects, it is inevitable that we will find ourselves working in a team to deliver a project. For this tutorial on Github and team collaboration, we will be exploring some of the most common tools that we generally need when working with software teams. The tools discussed are:

    Adding Team Members - Organization & Collaborators
    Pull Requests - Sending & Merging
    Bug Tracking - Github Issues
    Analytics - Graphs & Network
    Project Management - Trello & Pivotal Tracker
    Continuous Integration - Travis CI
    Code Review - Line Commenting & URL queries
    Documenting - Wiki & Hubot
